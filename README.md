Introduction:
A user wants to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they could plan a trip accordingly.   With a dashboard for inputs, when a user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city.   The current conditions for that city present the city name, the date, the icon representation, weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, the UV index.   When viewing the UV index, there is a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.  When the future weather conditions for the city are presented, there is a 5-day forecast that displays the weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
